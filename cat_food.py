#how many cats do i have and how much cat food do i need, print the result
# a new Python file called cat_food.py, create a program that calculates how many cans of cat food you need to feed 10 cats
#Your will need:
#A variable for the number of cats
#A variable for the number of cans each cat eats in a day
#A print() function to output the result
#Extension: change the calculation to work out the amount needed for 7 days

cat=10
can=10
total_cans=cat*can
output = "{} cats eat {} cans".format(cat, total_cans)
print(output)
